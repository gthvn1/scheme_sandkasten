We will follow the book *"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"*. A [free copy online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) is available.

More tutos, books and cool stuff are available at [https://schemers.org/](https://schemers.org/).

As **scheme** is the language used we will use [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).
